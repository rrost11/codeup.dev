<!-- The following line generates a random number between 0 and 5.
var luckyNumber = Math.floor(Math.random()* 6)
Now, suppose there's a promotion in Walmart, If your lucky number is 0 you have no discount, if your lucky number is 1 you'll get a 10% discount, if it's 2, discount is 25%, if it's 3, 35%, if it's 4, 50%, and if it's 5 you'll get all for free!. Write a JS program that logs to the console, how much you will have to pay if your receipt is for $60. Every time you reload your page you should see a different result. Use a switch statement for this exercise.
Suppose you have been assigned a task and you need to convert a number to the name of a month. 1 should be shown as January, 2 as February and so on. Using a switch statement write the JS code that shows the names of the months in the console.
Finally, save your work, commit the changes to your git repository, and push to GitHub.
