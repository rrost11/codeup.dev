<!-- We are going to build a simple list of your favorite things and display these in the form of a table in HTML.

Create a new file named my-favorite-things.php and put it in your public directory.
Create an array of your favorite things. This array should contain at least five things.
We will need to loop through this array and display each element inside your HTML.
Use an HTML table for this display.
Use CSS to add a light gray background on every other row for a nice effect.
Have fun and make it beautiful! -->

<?php

$myfavorites = ['Shelby the Beagle', 'Cheese Enchiladas', 'San Antonio Spurs', 'Chas', 'Traveling', 'Houston Texans'];
