<!-- FizzBuzz

One of the most common interview questions for entry-level programmers is the FizzBuzz test. Developed by Imran Ghory, the test is designed to test basic looping and conditional logic skills. The test can be solved using what you have learned so far, namely a for loop and some if statements, with a few echo statements.

On his blog, Ghory explains a FizzBuzz problem:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
