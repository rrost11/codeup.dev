What are functions?
	- Sequence of steps that give directions
	- Algorithm
	- Resuable code
	- Repeatable code
	- Takes input, puts output

What do functions do?
	- Do verbs, hand us nouns
	- Do a sequence of steps
	- Allow us to name that sequence of steps

When do you use functions?
	- When you have a related sequence of steps
	- When we're going to reuse soemthing
	- When naming a chunk of code helps us understand what that code does

Why do we use functions?
	- Reason about the business logic
	- We're able to code as close to natural language as possible

What does return do?
	- Return gives us a value as output
	- Stopes the function


Return vs. Console.log at the end of a function

function isOdd(number) {
	var output = (number % 2 == 0) ? true : false;
	return output;
}


function isOdd(number) {
	var output = (number % 2 == 0) ? true : false;
	console.log output;
}


In JavaScript - if you don't have a return, it returns "undefined"
